# PersonaExtract: Technical Approach

## Core Philosophy

PersonaExtract uses a **dynamic, adaptive approach** that avoids hardcoded logic and generalizes across all domains and personas. The system learns from the input persona and job description to identify relevant content.

## Key Components

### 1. Dynamic Keyword Extraction
- Extracts meaningful terms from persona and job descriptions
- Removes common stopwords and expands with stemmed variations
- No predefined keyword lists - fully adaptive

### 2. Semantic Similarity Matching
- Uses lightweight sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~90MB)
- Computes cosine similarity between persona queries and document sections
- Provides contextual understanding beyond keyword matching

### 3. Hybrid Scoring System
- Combines semantic similarity (70%) with keyword relevance (30%)
- Balances deep understanding with specific term matching
- Normalizes scores by content length to prevent bias

### 4. Structure-Aware Processing
- Dynamically identifies headings using font size and layout analysis
- Adapts to different document formats and languages
- Preserves document hierarchy and relationships

## Technical Optimizations

### Performance
- Batch processing for multiple documents
- Content truncation for embedding efficiency
- Efficient text processing with regex and counters

### Memory Management
- Lightweight models under 1GB constraint
- Streaming PDF processing
- Garbage collection between documents

### Generalizability
- No domain-specific assumptions
- Layout-agnostic section detection
- Multilingual text handling

## Quality Assurance

### Relevance Scoring
- Multiple relevance signals combined
- Title matching bonus weights
- Content length normalization

### Output Validation
- Structured JSON schema compliance
- Data type checking and sanitization
- Error handling and recovery

This approach ensures high-quality, persona-relevant extraction while maintaining generalizability across diverse domains and document types.
